# napari Cell Segmentation Course

**By [the Bravo Cohort](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/napari-segmentation-workshop/preface/whomadethis.html) üî¨**

Welcome to the napari Cell Segmentation course! This course will take a few hours to complete and will walk you from onboarding to napari to completing your first segmentation workflow using napari and plugins from the [napari hub](https://www.napari-hub.org). You can find all of the plugins needed for the course in this [Plugin Collection](https://www.napari-hub.org/collections/cell-segmentation-course).

Although napari currently requires some coding in Python, we designed each lesson in this course for researchers with *no prior coding* experience. Whenever coding is needed, we've provided you detailed instructions to follow. 
 
We want to emphasize that [napari](https://www.napari.org) itself is in the **alpha stage of development**‚Äîmeaning we are still actively updating and adding new napari features, including some core features you may have used on other analysis platforms.

If you encounter any issues, check the [napari Github issues](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues), the Github page for an individual plugin (linked on the [napari hub](https://www.napari-hub.org/) plugin page), [image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/tag/napari), or reach out at team@napari-hub.org.

## Overview
This course is split into 3 sections consisting of both video and text. In the **[preface](preface/landing.md)**, you‚Äôll learn about how this course came to be and find a list of resources for foundational image analysis concepts that will help you get the most out of these materials. In the **[onboarding section](onboard/landing.md)**, you‚Äôll learn more about what napari is, and be guided through installing napari and plugins on your computer. Finally in the **[workflows section](workflow/landing.md)**, you'll dig into three cell segmentation case studies (nuclei, foci in nuclei, and filaments) that illustrate how to perform a cell segmentation workflow from start to finish within napari, using sample data (or your own), and various napari plugins.
